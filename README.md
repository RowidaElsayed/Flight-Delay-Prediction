# Flight-Delay-Prediction
A machine learning project to predict airplane delays, including data processing, exploratory analysis, and model optimization using aws tools and machine learning techniques.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: From raw .zip files to a clean dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into patterns affecting flight delays.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Baseline model for predictions.
  - Advanced ensemble methods with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Feature Importance**: Understanding key drivers of flight delays.

## Business Scenario

This project aims to assist a travel booking website in improving customer experience by predicting potential flight delays. This will allow users to make more informed travel decisions.
